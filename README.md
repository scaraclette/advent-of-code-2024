# Advent of Pain
Mentally solved with Python.

Goals:
- Be more familiar with iterators
- Minimal use of external crates for problem solving logic
- Get used to split keyboard
- Resist the urge to refactor Rust code
    - How quick can I write un-refactored Rust code?
    - How quick can I come up with variable names on the go based on problem?
